# Flocking Simulation

A React application that demonstrates the flocking behavior of boids using p5.js. This simulation implements the classic boids algorithm with three main behaviors: alignment, cohesion, and separation.

## Features

- Interactive flocking simulation
- Real-time control over boid behaviors
- Smooth animation and performance
- Modern React-based UI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Controls

- **Alignment**: Controls how strongly boids align their direction with nearby boids
- **Cohesion**: Controls how strongly boids move toward the center of mass of nearby boids
- **Separation**: Controls how strongly boids avoid colliding with nearby boids

## Technologies Used

- React
- p5.js
- CSS3
